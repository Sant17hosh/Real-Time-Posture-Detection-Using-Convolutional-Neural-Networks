# Real-Time-Posture-Detection-Using-Convolutional-Neural-Networks
This project implements a deep learning model to classify human posture from images. It uses a CNN built with TensorFlow/Keras to detect five different postures. The dataset is extracted from a ZIP folder of frames and annotated via an Excel file.
